## Readme
This is an exercise of a chiral scaling fit. 
We fit the scaling function of the order parameter f_G(z) to data of the chiral condensate in (2+1)-flavor QCD. 
The fit uses the Shofield parametrization [1] of the scaling function. 
The data that is published with this repository was used in [2] and has been published in the corresponding supplemental meatrieal [3].
the code contains parts that have to be adjusted according to the exercises. 
A detaild description of the exercises are given in "description.pdf"
